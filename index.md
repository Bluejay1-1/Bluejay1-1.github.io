    ## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

Lab 1, part 1
I loved this lab because it was the very first lab we did. The lab consisted of creating strings and creating our git hub accounts. We needed to create strings that were compiled into statements. It was challenging at first because it was my first time coding a string with C++.

Lab 6, part 2
Part two of this lab was fun because it was challenging and I was able to create a game of blackjack using code. This lab taught me how to understand the use of if statements more clearly. It was challenging because it was my first time coding an if statement and barely learning it in lecture. 

Lab 11, part one
This is my favorite lab because I was able to use a constructor. When I was learning about a constructor in my lector class it seemed complicated and easy at the same time. I was using a constructor to set the states, population, and land area. It was fun to use and one of the easiest ways to code.
